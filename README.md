# Knights
University Challenge Assignment:
- Randomly fill an array of size 10x10 with True and False, displayed as 1 and 0 
- Outputs the number of chess knights needed to jump between 1s and visit all 1s 
  - They can jump back to locations previously visited

## Program Design Notes
* For this case, I designed a program that will start from an initial point and explore all possible knight movements from that position. 
* To do so the I check all possible knight movements recursively through the 'move' function embedded within the 'move_index' function

## Notes
* Received full marks for this challenge assignment
